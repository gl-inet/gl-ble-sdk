## 1. Build and compile

- Before using the DFU tool, you need to install the Openwrt SDK environment. Please set up the environment according to the following project documents: https://github.com/gl-inet/sdk.

- Secondly, you should clone the [gl-silabs-dfu](https://github.com/gl-inet/gl-silabs-dfu) repository into the package directory mentioned above. The version v1.3.1 is used when writing this document.

- The following is a general compile process.

```shell
# 1.Place your gl-silabs-dfu repository in sdk/<version>/<target>/package/, then run:
cd sdk/<version>/<target>/

# 2.compile
make package/gl-silabs-dfu/compile V=s
```



## 2. Select device BLE firmware

Currently, only supported for the GL-B2200 and GL-S200 to upgrade the BLE module firmware to v4.2.0. The following is the firmware corresponding to the device.

| Device   | BLE module firmware                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GL-B2200 | [gl-efr32mg21f512-ble-ncp-v4_2_0.gbl](./gl-efr32mg21f512-ble-ncp-v4_2_0.gbl) |
| GL-S200  | [gl-efr32mg21f768-ble-ncp-v4_2_0.gbl](gl-efr32mg21f768-ble-ncp-v4_2_0.gbl) |
